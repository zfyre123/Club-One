As with any decision of this nature, we anticipated questions would follow. We have done our best to respond to some of your initial questions here.

We will continue to stay in communication as we receive updates and further information that could influence our future decisions. *This is an unprecedented situation for us, so we will change course if we determine a better approach in the near future.*

 **\*\*Note:** Please click on hyperlinks to find the sources of information that have contributed to our decision-making process, which include government agencies, press releases, and factual articles recommended by health care professionals.

**Q: What’s the purpose of canceling practices and tournaments?**

A: Canceling sporting events falls under the disease containment category of “[social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/index.html).” The purpose of social distancing is to slow the rate at which a disease spreads—specifically a disease like COVID-19 [which appears to spread person-to-person](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html).

Though the majority of those infected have fully recovered, [early information indicates](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html) that elderly and/or immunocompromised populations—including individuals who already have cancer, lung disease, heart disease, and similar comorbidities—are at a higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.

While there is no consensus on how this virus will affect the US population, the rate of its spread and severity in other countries [varies greatly and seems to correlate](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-response-specialre/special-report-italy-and-south-korea-virus-outbreaks-reveal-disparity-in-deaths-and-tactics-idUSKBN20Z27P) with each country’s willingness to take early, aggressive proactive measures.

If we can proactively assist in slowing the rate at which the disease spreads, this ensures US hospitals and health care professionals will have the space and resources necessary to properly treat anyone infected. What we want to avoid is an early “spike” in cases that would overcrowd hospitals and place an impossible burden on health care professionals, [a situation Italy is facing at this time](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/who-gets-hospital-bed/607807/?utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_source=facebook&utm_term=2020-03-11T16%3A56%3A39&utm_content=edit-promo&utm_medium=social&fbclid=IwAR0VxUz4-mbMPPhLOCu4NO4JqNscI1a6Dkm7yd5moNPW4lBnHu2gsf2zCu0).

This strategy is also referred to as “[flattening the curve](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/who-gets-hospital-bed/607807/?utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_source=facebook&utm_term=2020-03-11T16%3A56%3A39&utm_content=edit-promo&utm_medium=social&fbclid=IwAR0VxUz4-mbMPPhLOCu4NO4JqNscI1a6Dkm7yd5moNPW4lBnHu2gsf2zCu0)”, by which we delay the peak of the outbreak AND reduce the peak number of cases.

**Q: Why should I practice “social distancing” if I’m not sick?**

A: Early reports indicate that symptoms of coronavirus can appear anywhere from [2-14 days after exposure](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html)to the virus. This means that a symptom-free individual could carry the virus and infect others. This is not a cause for panic, but it is important to be aware of. We each have a personal responsibility to [wash our hands and avoid spreading germs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html) to higher risk individuals.

**Q: Why are so many things being canceled all of a sudden? What happened?**

A: It’s hard to pinpoint one specific reason, because there was a series of events that took place between March 11th and March 12th, each influencing the other.

To name just a few:

- the World Health Organization [characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen)
- the President [delivered a statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAAmF3H0-ek) and announced additional protective measures in response to COVID-19
- the NBA [paused its season](https://www.nba.com/) until further notice
- USA Volleyball [recommended](https://www.teamusa.org/usa-volleyball/features/usa-volleyball-response-on-coronavirus) either canceling or postponing all USAV-sanctioned events until at least March 22nd
- the NCAA greatly limited attendance at events (and has since [canceled](https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/ncaa-cancels-remaining-winter-and-spring-championships) all remaining winter and spring competition)

In light of these decisions and our continuing understanding of the situation, we determined it is our responsibility to join with these athletics organizations and others and act proactively in the best interest of public health.

**Q: When will practices resume?**

A: We will send a follow-up communication on March 23rd with further information about plans for the remainder of the season. Nothing else has been determined at this time. We remain optimistic that early proactive measures will precede a quick return to life as usual.

**Q: Do I still have to pay monthly club fees?**

A: The option to pay club fees monthly is offered as a courtesy and is not tied to a specific amount of activity in any particular month.

We will diligently assess any prorations to club fees as needed based on activity missing and/or added by the end of your season. We are exploring options for replacing missed activities. Our ultimate goal is to provide the product each of you committed to at the start of the season, without any additional costs.

You can check your team’s TeamUp calendar for information on final due dates for your season. *Fee payments will continue as scheduled until that point.*

**Q: I prepaid for the season. Will I be refunded for missed tournaments and practices?**

A: We are waiting to see the extent of any cancellations and postponements, although we are hopeful that the proactive measures being taken will allow us all to quickly return to life as usual.

By the end of your season, we will diligently assess a prorated season amount as needed, whether through refunds, final payment reductions, or other means. You can check your team’s TeamUp calendar for information on final due dates for your season.

**Q: If there are no practices, what are the options for dropping off Player Fee payments?**

A: To find options for payment of Player Fees, click on any Fees Due Date on your team’s TeamUp calendar.

**Q: My daughter was hoping to be recruited at one of the canceled Junior National Qualifiers. What now?**

A: This is a difficult season for countless people, including college coaches and athletes, many of whom have had seasons canceled and are restricted from traveling for recruiting purposes. However, college coaches are still able to receive and review game and highlight film.

If you have questions about how to send game film to coaches, [check out the *c/r Featured Resource* and *c/r Answers* sections of this recent Court Report Newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/0fd6c947342e/recruiting-tips-weekend-recap-parent-forums).

 If you would like to schedule a one-on-one Recruiting Consultation, please send an email or text to Kelsey Girts, Assistant Club Director and 18Platinum Head Coach, at <kelsey@cluboneaz.com> or (716) 408-7733."

Between March 11th and March 12th, many athletics organizations in the U.S. have made the decision to cancel or postpone events, or keep them closed to the public, in an effort to limit any spread of COVID-19 to at-risk populations.

The information available to us at this point continues to show that the virus poses little threat to young, healthy members of the population. However, they would still have the potential to infect others. In order to protect elderly and/or immunocompromised individuals, who appear to be affected more adversely, canceling these events is a responsible decision.

Athletics organizations that have canceled or postponed events include the NBA, the PAC-12 and Ivy League conferences, the Colorado Crossroads and Spokane Junior National Qualifiers, and the Munciana (IN) and Legacy (MI) volleyball clubs, to name a few.

The prevailing sentiment behind these cancellations and postponements is not fear or panic, but rather a desire to make responsible decisions that will benefit the health of our communities.

**In order to do our part in promoting best practices for public health, we have determined to SUSPEND all Club One activities immediately, until further notice. We will send another update on March 23rd, per the recommendation of USA Volleyball.**

This includes but is not limited to:

-Team Practices

-Private Lessons

-Sports Performance Training

-Tutor Time

-Camps/Clinics

-Tournament Participation

We will not put any of our athletes, staff, or family members in the difficult position of deciding whether or not they should participate.

For those of you who were scheduled to attend the Colorado Crossroads and Spokane NQs, please know that the tournament staff are working diligently to begin what is certain to be a painstaking refund process. They plan to contact each team that was registered, as well as each Guest Registration purchaser. However, it will take several days to start this process, as they first must pack up and move all athletic and sponsor equipment out of the convention center facilities.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we navigate this unprecedented process together. We ask for your grace as we may not be able to respond to questions in a timely manner. We value your health and wellbeing above all else, and we will continue to stay in communication as more information becomes available."
